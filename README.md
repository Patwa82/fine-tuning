# fine-tuning

Fine-tuning with OCRA (Optical Character Recognition for Automobiles) datasets involves adapting a pre-trained OCR model to better recognize text specifically within the context of automotive environments. This process entails selecting a pre-existing OCR model trained on general text recognition and fine-tuning it on datasets containing images of automotive-related text, such as license plates, road signs, or vehicle instrument panels. By fine-tuning on OCRA datasets, the model learns to better handle the unique characteristics of automotive text, including varying fonts, angles, and lighting conditions, resulting in improved accuracy and reliability for OCR tasks within the automotive domain.
